To create a 3D cube that spins as I walk

Rory wants to see a something happen. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
I would like to feel connected with my phone, which is me in a digital world. A strange mustacheod squeaky thing in a minefield, floating along on light feet.

My intention is to create this project in three phases:

1/ Basic cube in Unity
2/ Spinning cube
3/ Three spin speeds as a function of clicks in a cycle (low-med-high-mid-low-mid-high etc.)
4/ sketches of interaction modes and situations of use.
5/ compile into Android package in Android Studio and export to phone.
6/ walk around, take notes, think about revisions.
7/ investigate accelerometer events in Unity, perhaps via Android Studio.
